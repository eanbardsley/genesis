<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

We suggest it is worthwhile to explore six-fold symmetry by itself. It is shown that the radius of a proton and its mass can be derived from a theory of space and time. To do this a theory for the atom is achieved because the theory of the proton needs the unit of a second as a natural duration which can be achieved from the atom that is made of these protons. A theory of the atom needs to utilize Avogadro’s Number. This is done by introducing the concept of intermediary mass. The concept of proton-seconds is introduced which results in a theory for compounds, combinations of atoms (which are combinations of protons). This is done for doped silicon and germanium which makes transistors and diodes enabling the engineering of logic circuit technology. It is also shown that the unit of a second is not just a natural duration where the atom is concerned, and hence the proton, but where the Earth-Moon-Sun orbital mechanics are concerned.</p>

<p>The recurrent six-fold symmetry follows through to the orbital parameters of celestial bodies which we show in the case of orbital velocity is 6 for all bodies, and that centripetal acceleration is six squared, and the orbital radii one. These values have to be translated into units that we can understand by introducing the calibration of the measuring stick used. These integer values for orbital parameters are converted by units used in a matrix transformation with the measuring stick matrix multiplied by the integer values of 1, 6, 6^2. The orbital parameters of the orbiting bodies are perfect, and the approximate answer in units we can apply is approximate not because of the motions of bodies in a gravitational field, but because of the nature of the man- made measuring stick. We can call this discovery Logos. The integer orbital parameters are arrived at by actually looking at the patterns of the moon and sun in the sky over time, which is how we divided the calendar since ancient times resulting in the duration of a second from a sexagesimal counting system (base 60). We see the formation of the calendar from these observations as the moon and sun appear in the sky it would turn out are connected to their actual physical nature. This prompts us to discuss the sexagesimal and its origins, and to introduce a cosmic calendar in sync with earth events.</p>

<p>Matter can be explained as a construct of space and time at the fundamental level of elementary particles, the elements of the periodic table follow from that construct. We demonstrate a recurrent six-fold symmetry of Nature and formulate logos, her language in abstract terms.</p>

<p>We find we can look at the world of subatomic particles which is inaccessible deterministically by quantum physics, by looking at the planets, moons, and Suns and that we can look at the planets, moons, and Suns by looking at the world of subatomic microcosmos, through the abstract.</p>

<p>In photographing atoms with ptychography the information received is not an image of atoms, and the image of the atoms is not a direct image but an inference based on a theory for the way particles interact with these particles that can only be validated by a direct image of the particles themselves. It is not necessarily an incorrect inference, but it would seem we can’t prove it is. This is where abstract natural systems comes in; we say it does not matter what is there, only that we have a working model or interpretation of the the atoms true or not because really these organizations of atoms can be treated as mathematical constructs.</p>

<p>Electron Microscopy, using electrons to see atoms, The photographs of atoms are more the scattering of electrons to look at them than the reflection which would be an actual image. But it is not attainable because in order to do this, to get the resolution required the electrons have to be increased to an energy that would destroy the material being looked at.</p>

<p>So they idea of abstract natural systems and my other work as well, abstract cosmology, is that what we are looking at is not necessarily continuous matter or discrete spherical particles, but at the simplest level, the mathematics of triangles, squares, hexagons, and pentagons, or octagons, which involve at their basis sqrt(2), sqrt(3), phi (the golden ratio) and so on…</p>

<p> It would seem to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity we need perhaps more to find an equation that takes us between formal systems than to have a synthesis. </p>

<p> This is two works, one dealing with humans and there relationship to Nature, and one the archaeology of other star systems, thus the relationship of life beyond Earth to Nature. It is the author’s hope that we will be able to find the common ground between the two.</p>

<p> Our history was forged by the elements and minerals beginning with stones to craft spearpoints and copper, silver, and gold beginning with using these metals to make tools and weapons to in the end electrical wire for advanced technology. It would seem other life on other planets around other stars would have been forged by the same things. Perhaps they even had a moon that hung in their sky to completely eclipse their star as ours does with the Sun, letting us know that we are part of something cosmic. Perhaps there are subtle variations in their history, and they have an ancient history as vast and intriguing as ours. Perhaps one day we will go to other star systems, even become part of a galactic, or even intergalactic society and we will learn their histories and perhaps from them even learn something about ourselves and our histories.</p>

<p> The idea that life could be part of a Universal Natural Process has been around for some time, perhaps starting with the astronomer Fred Hoyle. In my effort to show artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs I had formed a new constant that was interesting in itself. This short paper treats just it and what follows from it, since it has life connected to more universal values such as Planck’s constant, the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, the fine structure constant, the radius of a proton, and the mass of a proton. A program is written that shows it has incredible properties that predict all of the elements. It is suggested that its value is in design so a definition of design is used from Buckminster Fuller’s Synergetics. Ultimately, in the end the constant seems to be in step with the phases of the moon and the earth and they way they were divided-up by the Ancients to give us the calendar we have today. All of this in terms to be connected to the structure of the basis of geometry as founded on fundamental principles. </p>
