<p>Genesis Project strives to solve the mystery of creation. At the bottom of each page in parts 1, 2. 3 .4 .5 ,6
there will be links to click on; they will take you to the old homepage, not the new one(Last updated Dec 16 2020)</p>

<p>(June 30 2021) Essentially, there exists a good deal. If there is a parallel universe to ours but that has different laws of physics than ours it could be quite possible our poison is their nectar and their poison is our nectar, we can take from their universe what they don’t want and they can take from ours what we don’t want. Both sides benefit. As Mack said in Steinbeck’s Sweet Thursday “It’s a five frog profit and no one loses their shirt." I first encountered the idea in Asimov’s science fiction novel The Gods Themselves:</p>

<p>"The Plutonium/Tungsten can make its cycle endlessly back and forth between Universe and para-Universe, yielding energy first in one and then in another, with the net effect being a transfer of twenty electrons from our Universe to theirs per each nucleus cycled. Both sides gain energy from what is, in effect, an Inter-Universe Electron Pump."</p>

<p>We often think of ways to curb global warming. The crux of the problem lay in maintaining a habitable equilibrium state for the earth; like a ball displaced in a bowl, if one side represents too cold and the other side represents too hot, if the earth is out of equilibrium, the ball will roll down from the cool side past the center, which is a perfect temperature, then go up the other side which is too hot, until it slows down and drops down the same side to pass perfect temperature again at the center then go up the other side which is to too cold. As such it will oscillate between too cold and too hot, with in each pass slowing and not going up each side as high as it did in the previous cycle until it settles at the center at what is perfect temperature.</p>

<p>When it settles in the center the earth is in equilibrium, which means it is losing just as much heat from the sun as it gains.</p>

<p>Currently we are out of equilibrium absorbing 4 watts per square meter more than we lose, most of this due to too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, reradiating energy reflected off the Earth’s surface back to the Earth’s surface. When you are gaining more heat than you lose the planet is out of equilibrium and is warming. When you lose more heat than you gain the Earth is out of equilibrium as well, and is cooling.</p>

<p>One of the principle cooling mechanisms is energy from the sun going into evaporating water in the oceans which becomes clouds that eventually precipitate returning the water to them in what is called the water-cycle.</p>

<p>But like this perhaps we can cool the earth by somehow creating substances that take in some of the heat from the sun and crackle, bend, and warp, meaning this energy from the sun was lost doing mechanical work on breaking apart its atoms.</p>

<p>Another principle cooling effect is the Earth’s reflective index which measures what percent of the Sun’s incident energy is reflected back out into space. So perhaps like in Asimov’s parallel universe, we can open up a portal into which excess heat from the sun can dissipate, effectively increasing the space near the surface of the earth without making the planet larger.</p>
