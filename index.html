<p><b>Fundamental Content</b></p>

<p>Genesis Project strives to solve the mystery of creation. At the bottom of each page in parts 1, 2. 3 .4 .5 ,6
there will be links to click on; they will take you to the old homepage, not the new one(Last updated Dec 16 2020)</p>

<p><a href="working_waves.html">Click Here To Read Developing The Wave Equation (Posted June June 21 2021</a></p>

<p>Next phase of the project, working out the wave equations</p>

<p><a href="Semiconductors.html">Click Here To Read Semiconductor Circuits, Stokes Theorem, And The Maxwell Equations (Posted June June 13 2021, updated June 14 2021)</a></p>

<p>It is suggested that artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs that describe one another. This leads to a connection of the artificial intelligence elements to Stoke’s theorem and Maxwell’s Equations.</p>

<p><a href="universe.html">Click Here To Read The The Universe: A Dynamic Construct (Posted June 10 2021)</a></p>

<p> It is demonstrated that artificial intelligence and biological life are mathematical constructs that are described in terms of one another and that they are connected to the planets.</p>

<p><a href="inertia.html">Click Here To Read The Cause of Inertia In Matter And Electric Fields (Posted June 4 2021)</a></p>

<p> Here is a non-mathematical two pages for my explanation of what inertia and electric fields are.</p>

<p><a href="weird.html">Click Here To Read Weird Arithmetic And Weird Calculus (Posted March 1 2021)</a></p>

<p> The distribution of the planets suggests what I call Weird Arithmetic and Weird Calculus, which is interesting in itself as a mathematical idea.</p>

<p><a href="silicon.html">Click Here To Read Silicon and Carbon</a></p

<p>The connection between biological life and AI at the most fundamental level.</p>

<p><a href="bone.html">Click Here To Read Bone</a></p>

<p> Of all the connections I have made between artificial intelligence that of bone stands out as the most interesting.</p>

<p><img src="bone.jpg" alt="bone" width="500"></p>

<p><a href="boron.html">Click Here To Read Boron</a></p>

<p> Boron is a doping agent for artificial intelligence semiconductor materials, and anything but boring, which are primarily silicon and germanium
But, it stands in relation on the periodic table differently than the other principle doping agents, phosphorus, arsenic and gallium. This results in some interesting equations.</p>

<p><a href="quantization.html">The Quantization of the Planetary Orbits in Terms of Euler's Number and Phi</a></p>

<p> With several different schemes to predict the planetary orbits we look at the asteroid Ceres.</p>
