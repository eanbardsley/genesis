<p>A very interesting thing here is looking at the values generated by the program, the smallest integer value, 1 second produces 6 protons (carbon) and the largest integer values 6 seconds produces one proton (hydrogen). Beyond six seconds you have fractional protons, and the rest of the elements heavier than carbon are formed by fractional seconds.</p>

<div><p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">There has come to be need for me to elaborate in more lay terms on this paper.</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">Great question it is at the basis of what I was thinking when I formulated the idea. Because we have 6 protons even if we divide</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">(1/<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">ùù∞</span>¬≤)(1/m<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">ùò±</span>)‚àö(h4<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">ùõë</span>r<span style="font-family: STIXGeneral; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">ùëù</span>¬≤/Gc)</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">By 1 second. Six protons is carbon C, it has six protons and 6 neutrons. Historically we developed the mole 6E23 atoms to be the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon, so it is the basis from which we determine the molar mass of all the other elements. If we divide the above by six seconds conversely we have one proton. Thus hydrogen and carbon are like cycling through a factor of six with respect to one another. Hydrogen and carbon form hydrocarbons; because carbon has four electrons in its outer shell it can combine with other elements (C4-) it can make long chains with hydrogen that has a deficiency of one electron (H+). These hydrocarbons define organic matter, the chemistry of which is studied in organic chemistry. Life is made of organic compounds, but not all organic compounds are produced by life which was realized when they synthesized urea in the laboratory, but most are.</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">However if we equate 3 times the above equation to 18 protons, where there are 18 groups in the periodic table of the elements, and evaluate this at one second we get the radius of a proton 0.833 fm within experimental errors using the most accurate values we have for input to all of their digits.</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">18 groups in the periodic table mean the properties of the elements cycle through 18 groups in a way that the groups define the physical properties of the elements that belong to them. That is, for example take carbon in group 14, when it reacts with a non-metal it gains four electrons to attain noble gas electron configuration where the noble gases are the elements in group 18. Thus to determine that carbon gains 4 electrons for forming bonds, we take group 18 and subtract it from group 14 to get 4 electrons, this is how we determine in chemistry that carbon becomes C4-.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">But this is to say that the elements are protons with electrons circling them and the number of shells increase as you move to the right and increase protons. This is called the Bohr atom, we say when an electron jumps from one shell to another, then falls back discrete amounts of energy (photons) are emitted related to the difference of the numbers of the shells.</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">But these shells or circular orbits don‚Äôt exist, however we can predict all the above if we say they do. In fact, according to quantum mechanics the protons are surrounded by clouds that predict the probability of where an electron will be. In this sense, people have a problem with quantum mechanics when first learning it because probability that an electron will be in region of space is not to say it will, so the electron does not have position. There is nothing deterministic. That is an idea for classical mechanics. Yet again, like in chemistry we can treat things this way and get results.</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">So,‚Ä¶to make a long story short, I thought why not do physics like we do chemistry, and use proton seconds as above in the equation which has units of protons times seconds. Proton-seconds I then define as a number of protons per second through a surface. It is not necessarily anything like alpha decay, that is why at the beginning of the paper I said this idea is abstract, like the electron shells in a Bohr atom, or the clouds we get from the wave treatment of matter in quantum mechanics. None of it really exists.</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">I then thought to outline a process where we solve the above equation for integer values with respect to time by not computing the equation by hand a thousand times but by writing code that the computer can execute. Thus I was suggesting the method of proton-seconds would be best used by making coding an integral part of doing mathematics, which in today‚Äôs day and age I don‚Äôt see as a ludicrous suggestion. When I made a program that found integer solutions, I found the elements were produced by number very close to integers which we need because you can‚Äôt have a half a proton, or 3./4 a proton. The program was producing all the elements in the periodic table which are determined by the number of protons they have.</p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"><br /></p>
<p style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">So, next I found we could solve physics problems by associating a time value with protons, and as such predict the relative abundances of Hydrogen and Helium that make up 98% of the universe using Schrodinger‚Äôs wave equation.</p>

<p><a href="squaring_circle_2.html">Click here to read Proton-Seconds And Squaring The Circle Second Edition (Posted March 9 2022)</a></p>

<p>It is quite simple though, one second determines the radius of a proton accurately thus integer multiplies of the second determine the protons in the other elements  (equation 3) in turn with these time values  for protons the wave equation predicts the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe (page 21) which taken together make up about 98% of the matter in the universe and from which all other elements are made by stars. It also determines a definition for the radius of the solar system which is interesting because while we can do such with atoms, it could be beneficial for the stars systems. The result is interesting because it includes Pluto which not too long ago was removed from the solar system as one of its planets. To learn the history of that read ‚ÄúHow I killed Pluto and Why it had it Coming‚Äù by Mike Brown.</p>

<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p> With the method of proton-seconds we can solve a great deal of problems easily. They define a definition for the radius of the solar system and predict the radius of a proton within its experimental errors to predicting the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe from which the heavier elements are made in the interior of stars. It is doing physics with a chemistry methodology.</p>

<p> We discover a constant that predicts hydrocarbons (the backbones of life) and determines a definition for the radius of the solar system, predicts the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe from which the heavier elements were made, the relative abundances of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth atmosphere, and that predicts the radius of the proton within its experimental errors. Incredibly this all ties into the ancient Babylonian origins of the calendar and their sexagesimal counting system. While this reconciles a lot between Newtonian Gravity and Quantum Mechanics, it becomes as well an Archaeological problem. </p>

<p>It would seem to not only are artificial intelligence elements mathematical constructs, but so are biological life elements, and they are described in terms of one another, this is the subject of part 1. It becomes necessary to say if these elements are subject to mathematical constructs then matter, or inertia is a mathematical construct. This results in a constant that not only predicts the hydrocarbons, the skeletons of life, but determines a definition for the radius of the solar system and predicts the radius of the proton. This is part 2. In part 3 we show this takes the form of a gaussian distribution meaning it can all be solved with wave mechanics. This leads to predicting the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium from which the other elements are made by stars in nucleosynthesis.</p>

<p>It is a mind blower that the constant on page 32 predicts the radius of a proton within the experimental errors which are within 14 thousandths of a femtometer using a time value of exactly 1 second because the second originated over ancient times as a means of parsing the phases of the earth and the moon. This is an archaeological problem and the reason for it might be deeply profound.</p>

<p>As we progress from carbon to the hydrocarbon skeletons of life we progress through proportions of the nitrogen and oxygen of the air through the same proportions in the components of sand and minerals found in semiconductor materials as distributed across the solar system in a linearly decreasing form of a thin disc. This ties into the duration of second, which derives from the orbital periods of the earth and moon as structured in the calendar we have today from basic fundamental geometrical relationships. Here we have a way to define the radius of the solar system and we predict the radius of the proton within its most recent experimental errors.</p>

<p>
The first part was a result of the need to develop the second part which describes life and AI elements as mathematical constructs connected to one another. But it was interesting in itself as it lead to a theoretical value for the proton radius in agreement with experiment and a definition of the radius of the solar system connected to the skeletons of life (hydrocarbons) and earth air.

<p> Here we have a way to define the radius of the solar system. As well at the end of the paper I give a theoretical value for the radius of a proton from this which is in close to the most recent measurements, and is good in terms of chemistry by say of what is suggested by our proton-seconds. Further it predicts the hydrocarbons the basic skeletons of life and the duration of a second which originates in the way we structured the calendar to the phases of the earth and the moon.</p>

<p> The idea that life could be part of a Universal Natural Process has been around for some time, perhaps starting with the astronomer Fred Hoyle. In my effort to show artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs I had formed a new constant that was interesting in itself. This short paper treats just it and what follows from it, since it has life connected to more universal values such as Planck‚Äôs constant, the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, the fine structure constant, the radius of a proton, and the mass of a proton. A program is written that shows it has incredible properties that predict all of the elements. It is suggested that its value is in design so a definition of design is used from Buckminster Fuller‚Äôs Synergetics. Ultimately, in the end the constant seems to be in step with the phases of the moon and the earth and they way they were divided-up by the Ancients to give us the calendar we have today. All of this in terms to be connected to the structure of the basis of geometry as founded on fundamental principles. </p>


<p><a href="Alpha_Centauri.html">Click here to read Archaeology of the Alpha Centauri Star System (Posted December 23 2021)</a></p>

<p>We do archaeology on Earth concerning the origins of humans and their thoughts about the world around them from ancient to modern times. The moon orbits the earth once in about 30 days, and does twelve of these revolutions in the time it takes the Earth to go around the Sun. The Druids who built Stonehenge knew this, and the Mayans who built their pyramids in Mexico observed it, and well as the Egyptians who built the Great Pyramid of Giza. All of these structures have celestial alignments, and the calendar we have today came from such knowledge of these ancients. But can we surmise what kind of calendar came into existence from the ancient astronomers of a planet orbiting another star? The stars are out of our reach, at least for resolving a moon orbiting a planet orbiting a star, but we can ascertain that planets exist around other stars, and even infer their mass, and orbital period. If we can start to know these things about other star systems, is it possible other life has begun to know them about ours. Or, have they perhaps even been here, or are they here now? I look into this here.</p>


<p><a href="universal_process.html">Click here to read Life As A Universe Unfolding Eventuation (Posted December 15 2021)</a></p>

<p>Produce the elements for values less than 1 and greater than zero (fractional values) 1 second produces hydrogen and 6 seconds produces carbon, and these are the lower and upper limits for integers producing a whole number of elements, putting hydrocarbons, the backbone of life chemistry as having components out of phase with one another by cycles of six in seconds. Seconds come from having divided the calendar according to the cycles of the moon, the spin frequency of the Earth, and its orbital period such that they all mesh with one another approximately according to special angles recurrent throughout mathematics and physics. These two equations have G, the universal gravitational constant among other parameters associated with the physics of everything. The cycle of six for the phase shift from hydrogen to carbon may be characteristic of physical forces because six-fold symmetry is often more characteristic of the physical where five-fold is more characteristic of life as was pointed-out by the Russian Scientist Shubnikov. One might look at this as something physical, like snowflakes form six points (six-fold radial symmetry) due to acceleration of an ice particulate against air gathering moisture and freezing it as it falls under earth gravity, and five-fold symmetry, as in the large variety of five-petaled flowers (five-fold radial symmetry) because it has the golden ratio in it, the ratio of the chord of a regular pentagon to its side, and six-fold symmetry embodies unity as the radius of a regular hexagon is equal to its side and the golden ratio is often used by life for closest packing, as occurs in the hundreds of petals in a rose spiraling in as a golden spiral to its center. These equation take us through a Universe-unfolding eventuation considering meteors, sand, and iron, and indeed themselves.</p>
