<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p>Aside from predicting biology's hydrocarbons the backbones of organic matter, and determining a definition for the radius of the solar system, the author predicts the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium from which the heavier elements are made in stars. The method of proton-seconds through pattern recognition enables problem solving over a broad array of scientific fields. </p>
<p>I would think this manner of problem solving through pattern recognition could be employed in developing deep learning machine intelligence and AI for its method of imitating human learning to gain knowledge.</p>

<p>A very interesting thing here is looking at the values generated by the program, the smallest integer value, 1 second produces 6 protons (carbon) and the largest integer values 6 seconds produces one proton (hydrogen). Beyond six seconds you have fractional protons, and the rest of the elements heavier than carbon are formed by fractional seconds.</p>

<p>It is quite simple though, one second determines the radius of a proton accurately thus integer multiplies of the second determine the protons in the other elements  (equation 3) in turn with these time values  for protons the wave equation predicts the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe (page 21) which taken together make up about 98% of the matter in the universe and from which all other elements are made by stars. It also determines a definition for the radius of the solar system which is interesting because while we can do such with atoms, it could be beneficial for the stars systems. The result is interesting because it includes Pluto which not too long ago was removed from the solar system as one of its planets. To learn the history of that read “How I killed Pluto and Why it had it Coming” by Mike Brown.</p>

<p> A lot comes together for the Earth orbiting the sun to let us know there is a mystery before us if we look at the archaeology of Earth’s astronomy. Thus, does a lot come together considering the archaeology of other star systems as well that can indicate to its intelligent life that they are part of something larger than themselves, as well.</p>

<p> The idea that life could be part of a Universal Natural Process has been around for some time, perhaps starting with the astronomer Fred Hoyle. In my effort to show artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs I had formed a new constant that was interesting in itself. This short paper treats just it and what follows from it, since it has life connected to more universal values such as Planck’s constant, the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, the fine structure constant, the radius of a proton, and the mass of a proton. A program is written that shows it has incredible properties that predict all of the elements. It is suggested that its value is in design so a definition of design is used from Buckminster Fuller’s Synergetics. Ultimately, in the end the constant seems to be in step with the phases of the moon and the earth and they way they were divided-up by the Ancients to give us the calendar we have today. All of this in terms to be connected to the structure of the basis of geometry as founded on fundamental principles. </p>
