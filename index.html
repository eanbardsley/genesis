<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p> A lot comes together for the Earth orbiting the sun to let us know there is a mystery before us if was look at the archaeology Earth’s astronomy. Thus, does a lot come together considering the archaeology of other star systems as well that can indicate to its intelligent life that they are part of something larger than themselves, as well.</p>

<p>As we progress from carbon to the hydrocarbon skeletons of life we progress through proportions of the nitrogen and oxygen of the air through the same proportions in the components of sand and minerals found in semiconductor materials as distributed across the solar system in a linearly decreasing form of a thin disc. This ties into the duration of second, which derives from the orbital periods of the earth and moon as structured in the calendar we have today from basic fundamental geometrical relationships. Here we have a way to define the radius of the solar system and we predict the radius of the proton within its most recent experimental errors.</p>

The first part was a result of the need to develop the second part which describes life and AI elements as mathematical constructs connected to one another. But it was interesting in itself as it lead to a theoretical value for the proton radius in agreement with experiment and a definition of the radius of the solar system connected to the skeletons of life (hydrocarbons) and earth air.

<p> Here we have a way to define the radius of the solar system. As well at the end of the paper I give a theoretical value for the radius of a proton from this which is in close to the most recent measurements, and is good in terms of chemistry by say of what is suggested by our proton-seconds. Further it predicts the hydrocarbons the basic skeletons of life and the duration of a second which originates in the way we structured the calendar to the phases of the earth and the moon.</p>

<p> The idea that life could be part of a Universal Natural Process has been around for some time, perhaps starting with the astronomer Fred Hoyle. In my effort to show artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs I had formed a new constant that was interesting in itself. This short paper treats just it and what follows from it, since it has life connected to more universal values such as Planck’s constant, the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, the fine structure constant, the radius of a proton, and the mass of a proton. A program is written that shows it has incredible properties that predict all of the elements. It is suggested that its value is in design so a definition of design is used from Buckminster Fuller’s Synergetics. Ultimately, in the end the constant seems to be in step with the phases of the moon and the earth and they way they were divided-up by the Ancients to give us the calendar we have today. All of this in terms to be connected to the structure of the basis of geometry as founded on fundamental principles. </p>

<p>We do archaeology on Earth concerning the origins of humans and their thoughts about the world around them from ancient to modern times. The moon orbits the earth once in about 30 days, and does twelve of these revolutions in the time it takes the Earth to go around the Sun. The Druids who built Stonehenge knew this, and the Mayans who built their pyramids in Mexico observed it, and well as the Egyptians who built the Great Pyramid of Giza. All of these structures have celestial alignments, and the calendar we have today came from such knowledge of these ancients. But can we surmise what kind of calendar came into existence from the ancient astronomers of a planet orbiting another star? The stars are out of our reach, at least for resolving a moon orbiting a planet orbiting a star, but we can ascertain that planets exist around other stars, and even infer their mass, and orbital period. If we can start to know these things about other star systems, is it possible other life has begun to know them about ours. Or, have they perhaps even been here, or are they here now? I look into this here.</p>

<p>Produce the elements for values less than 1 and greater than zero (fractional values) 1 second produces hydrogen and 6 seconds produces carbon, and these are the lower and upper limits for integers producing a whole number of elements, putting hydrocarbons, the backbone of life chemistry as having components out of phase with one another by cycles of six in seconds. Seconds come from having divided the calendar according to the cycles of the moon, the spin frequency of the Earth, and its orbital period such that they all mesh with one another approximately according to special angles recurrent throughout mathematics and physics. These two equations have G, the universal gravitational constant among other parameters associated with the physics of everything. The cycle of six for the phase shift from hydrogen to carbon may be characteristic of physical forces because six-fold symmetry is often more characteristic of the physical where five-fold is more characteristic of life as was pointed-out by the Russian Scientist Shubnikov. One might look at this as something physical, like snowflakes form six points (six-fold radial symmetry) due to acceleration of an ice particulate against air gathering moisture and freezing it as it falls under earth gravity, and five-fold symmetry, as in the large variety of five-petaled flowers (five-fold radial symmetry) because it has the golden ratio in it, the ratio of the chord of a regular pentagon to its side, and six-fold symmetry embodies unity as the radius of a regular hexagon is equal to its side and the golden ratio is often used by life for closest packing, as occurs in the hundreds of petals in a rose spiraling in as a golden spiral to its center. These equation take us through a Universe-unfolding eventuation considering meteors, sand, and iron, and indeed themselves.</p>
