<p> An effort is made to show that life, whether artificial or biological, does not just follow the laws of chemistry, but is mathematical in Nature. Since we understand biological life in terms of artificial intelligence (AI) and AI in terms of biological life we must first find the connection between the two. To do this we must do it in terms of measurable numbers, like molar mass, density, and atomic radius, if it is to be that it is mathematical in nature.</p>

<p> I first show that the most basic structure of much of life, the skeleton, is algebraic with respect to AI in molar mass and density. I then create from this certain mathematical operators which yield -30 (negative 30) with each successive application to other substances, like water, air and earth.</p>

<p> We then go on to the interesting case of what results in the AI elements because of boron, then to the amino acids. I have not figured out an approach to DNA yet, because I think it stands outside of all this encoding the mathematics used on the elements to make life.</p>

<p> The Titius-Bode rule describes the distribution of the planets around the sun, but starts to fail pretty bad at Neptune. I have devised several schemes in terms of various factors to describe the distribution of the planets. One prominent feature in these instances is that two planets stick out in their characteristics, Venus and Mars. Other than Mercury and Earth, these are the solid, terrestrial planets; the rest are gas giants. They are on either side of the Earth and the closest to it. Venus is closer to the Sun than our Earth and Mars is further. Venus and Mars have always been of great interest to us. Venus to the Russians as they have sent several probes to it and Mars to the United States as we have sent several roaming landers to it. This is interesting, Venus is often called the sister planet to Earth, because it is of similar size and mass as Earth. It would seem she was once much cooler but underwent a runaway greenhouse effect making it too hot to be habitable, hence its interest to the Russians, and Mars while further from the sun and colder than the Earth, it is still habitable, and thus colonizable, and hence its interest to the United States. Interestingly in our search for life on Mars, we recently found hints of microbial life in the atmosphere of Venus (2020). Often I don’t include Mercury because it is so small and not very massive so it didn’t contribute much to the nature of the protoplanetary disc from which the planets formed, and mostly because its orbit is so eccentric that it might not make sense to consider its average orbital distance. The purpose of this paper is to explore the equations of Venus and Mars, as they are pivotal in the  importance of human destine. I also pull perfect expression out of different schemes to begin to make a perfect table. The schemes have theoretical implications in mathematics and physics, but this is treated in other works. It would seem running through the thread of solar system origin and structure is the recurring motif of artificial intelligence logic circuitry theory. Guessing a solution to a weird problem requires weird mathematics. I create weird arithmetic. It would seem the distribution of the planets have an AI motif. At this point I suggest that it defies a single algebraic expression because it may be that it uses logic gate arithmetic, which does not follow arithmetic as is done in mathematics, but rather in creating logic circuits with the seven basic gates.</p>

<p> Of all the connections I have made between artificial intelligence that of bone stands out as the most interesting.</p>

<p> Boron is a doping agent for artificial intelligence semiconductor materials, and anything but boring, which are primarily silicon and germanium
But, it stands in relation on the periodic table differently than the other principle doping agents, phosphorus, arsenic and gallium. This results in some interesting equations.</p>
