<p>Genesis Project strives to solve the mystery of creation. At the bottom of each page in parts 1, 2. 3 .4 .5 ,6

<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p>We establish a constants called proton-seconds and a formulation I call Giordano’s Relationship, and find we can solve problems across a wide array of disciplines including predicting the radius of a proton which is centered around carbon, the core element of biological life as we know it, defining the radius of the solar system, and predicting the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe.</p>

<p> Life is intricately complex and a lot of perfect circumstances come together to make it possible. It may be that someone or something is responsible for it. It may be as well that we can find something hidden that can be measured here on Earth and from Earth that can tell us something about the human scenario, why we are here, and where we are headed. In the course of my research I have found some clues that may be precisely this. They are outlined here.</p>

<p>We can infer the existence of a planet around a star we cannot see, but can we say something about the archaeology of its people as well.</p>

<p><a href="patterns.html">Click here to read Reality As Patterns: The Method of Proton-Seconds. (Posted March 27 2022)</a></p>

<p> We introduce the concept of Proton-Seconds and see it lends itself to a method of solving problems across a large range of disciplines in the Natural Sciences. The underpinnings seem to be in 6-fold symmetry. This lends itself to a Universal Form. We find this presents the Periodic Table of the Elements as a squaring of the circle. It is rather abstract thinking, but just as the moment we define truth and as a result it reverses, I think we can treat problem solving this way: As Patterns…The idea is there is nothing we can say is the truth, but we can solve problems through pattern recognition. I would think this manner of problem solving through pattern recognition could be employed in developing deep learning machine intelligence and AI for its method of imitating human learning to gain knowledge.</p>

<p>A very interesting thing here is looking at the values generated by the program, the smallest integer value, 1 second produces 6 protons (carbon) and the largest integer values 6 seconds produces one proton (hydrogen). Beyond six seconds you have fractional protons, and the rest of the elements heavier than carbon are formed by fractional seconds.</p>

<p> The idea that life could be part of a Universal Natural Process has been around for some time, perhaps starting with the astronomer Fred Hoyle. In my effort to show artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs I had formed a new constant that was interesting in itself. This short paper treats just it and what follows from it, since it has life connected to more universal values such as Planck’s constant, the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, the fine structure constant, the radius of a proton, and the mass of a proton. A program is written that shows it has incredible properties that predict all of the elements. It is suggested that its value is in design so a definition of design is used from Buckminster Fuller’s Synergetics. Ultimately, in the end the constant seems to be in step with the phases of the moon and the earth and they way they were divided-up by the Ancients to give us the calendar we have today. All of this in terms to be connected to the structure of the basis of geometry as founded on fundamental principles. </p>
