<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

There is some indication that 1 second is a natural duration, and I show the duration of 1 second may be tied into Quantum Field Theory because with it the gravitational constant G outside of quantum mechanics is coupled with Planck’s constant, h intrinsic to quantum mechanics, and that this predicts the radius of a proton through six-fold symmetry within experimental errors, as well as the hydrocarbons, the skeletons of biological life chemistry. To understand the meaning of a second, and why it might be a natural duration I explore its origins that began with the Sumerians, who mysteriously overnight started civilization in Mesopotamia. The mathematics they used was sexagesimal and this is why the duration of a second is what it is. I show both that this duration in our calendar that comes to us from the Babylonians who used sexagesimal as well, and the Ancient Greeks who did as well, to reconcile the motion of the moon with that of the Earth, is in the orbital dynamics of the earth and moon, and in sexagesimal itself. A constant is established as well from Giordano’s relationship that uses molar mass and the Chandrasekhar limit for a star to not collapse and become a white dwarf star, that predicts our six-fold symmetry. In the end we show the diameter of the solar system can be written in astronomical units as the golden ratio over 100 times 360 of a circle and that the radius of a proton is the area of a circle inscribed in an equilateral triangle divided by pi in terms of the metric system. This results in a theory for the periodic table of the elements as a mathematical construct. Also we we predict with proton- seconds the natural relative abundances of the primordial elements hydrogen and helium. We demonstrate a mathematics for abstract cosmology. </p>

<p>Abstract Cosmology is not concrete because the truth, if such a thing can even be shown to exist, escapes us at every juncture. Abstract cosmology looks for form in the relationship between point, plane, line, angle, etc...and and suggests it exists in Nature. With this process we will determine the radius of the proton, that makes the atom, predict the relationships between elements, in particular in the hydrocarbons that are the skeletons of life chemistry. We will move up in scale to the radius of the solar system, and in the end predict the relative abundances of the most abundant elements — the primordial elements hydrogen and helium — that make up 98% of the Universe. Along the way we will find the proportions of the primary constituents of the air that makes up the Earth atmosphere, and show they are integral to water geometrically. We will offer interpretations for space, time, and matter (inertia). It won’t be as important as to what the interpretations are as much as it will be that we can have them. It is done like this because it is suggested that reality is a construct of the mind, so models are only useful as tools to manipulate components in the mind.</p>

<p>This version has been expanded and as far the the author can tell typos all corrected, any arithmetic errors have been rectified and in his opinion has quite an extraordinary conclusion.</p>

<p> It would seem to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity we need perhaps more to find an equation that takes us between formal systems than to have a synthesis. </p>

<p><a href="Natural_Units.html">Click here to read The Search For Natural Units (Posted April 8 2022)</a></p>

<p>The units we use to measure physical quantities for mass, length, and time belong to several different systems of measurement. This results in slight variations in our answers whether we say use a foot or a centimeter to measure distance. It would be to the advantage of physics if we could find what will call natural units. This paper lightly explores the concept and strives to show such values already exist close to being natural if we look at constants and their relationship to physical reality.</p>

<p>It could be useful to use these, or even establish some that are more perfect, because they are connected to natural phenomenon which have explanations. If we use them as we do physics we might have Natural discoveries falling out on our laps. This might explain why when we do physics with such units for time and length that strange things we consider extraordinary coincidences, happen. It might actually be that they are often not coincidences at all.</p> 

<p>I think one of the most fascinating aspects of the search for natural units would be when we go to other star systems in the future and meet other civilizations and we learn of their units and how they might be founded on the physical principles behind they dynamics of their planet, star (or stars) and perhaps moons.</p>

<p> This is two works, one dealing with humans and there relationship to Nature, and one the archaeology of other star systems, thus the relationship of life beyond Earth to Nature. It is the author’s hope that we will be able to find the common ground between the two.</p>

<p> Our history was forged by the elements and minerals beginning with stones to craft spearpoints and copper, silver, and gold beginning with using these metals to make tools and weapons to in the end electrical wire for advanced technology. It would seem other life on other planets around other stars would have been forged by the same things. Perhaps they even had a moon that hung in their sky to completely eclipse their star as ours does with the Sun, letting us know that we are part of something cosmic. Perhaps there are subtle variations in their history, and they have an ancient history as vast and intriguing as ours. Perhaps one day we will go to other star systems, even become part of a galactic, or even intergalactic society and we will learn their histories and perhaps from them even learn something about ourselves and our histories.</p>

<p>We establish a constants called proton-seconds and a formulation I call Giordano’s Relationship, and find we can solve problems across a wide array of disciplines including predicting the radius of a proton which is centered around carbon, the core element of biological life as we know it, defining the radius of the solar system, and predicting the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe.</p>

<p> Life is intricately complex and a lot of perfect circumstances come together to make it possible. It may be that someone or something is responsible for it. It may be as well that we can find something hidden that can be measured here on Earth and from Earth that can tell us something about the human scenario, why we are here, and where we are headed. In the course of my research I have found some clues that may be precisely this. They are outlined here.</p>

<p>We can infer the existence of a planet around a star we cannot see, but can we say something about the archaeology of its people as well.</p>

<p>A very interesting thing here is looking at the values generated by the program, the smallest integer value, 1 second produces 6 protons (carbon) and the largest integer values 6 seconds produces one proton (hydrogen). Beyond six seconds you have fractional protons, and the rest of the elements heavier than carbon are formed by fractional seconds.</p>

<p> The idea that life could be part of a Universal Natural Process has been around for some time, perhaps starting with the astronomer Fred Hoyle. In my effort to show artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs I had formed a new constant that was interesting in itself. This short paper treats just it and what follows from it, since it has life connected to more universal values such as Planck’s constant, the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, the fine structure constant, the radius of a proton, and the mass of a proton. A program is written that shows it has incredible properties that predict all of the elements. It is suggested that its value is in design so a definition of design is used from Buckminster Fuller’s Synergetics. Ultimately, in the end the constant seems to be in step with the phases of the moon and the earth and they way they were divided-up by the Ancients to give us the calendar we have today. All of this in terms to be connected to the structure of the basis of geometry as founded on fundamental principles. </p>
