<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p>We do archaeology on Earth concerning the origins of humans and their thoughts about the world around them from ancient to modern times. The moon orbits the earth once in about 30 days, and does twelve of these revolutions in the time it takes the Earth to go around the Sun. The Druids who built Stonehenge knew this, and the Mayans who built their pyramids in Mexico observed it, and well as the Egyptians who built the Great Pyramid of Giza. All of these structures have celestial alignments, and the calendar we have today came from such knowledge of these ancients. But can we surmise what kind of calendar came into existence from the ancient astronomers of a planet orbiting another star? The stars are out of our reach, at least for resolving a moon orbiting a planet orbiting a star, but we can ascertain that planets exist around other stars, and even infer their mass, and orbital period. If we can start to know these things about other star systems, is it possible other life has begun to know them about ours. Or, have they perhaps even been here, or are they here now? I look into this here.</p>

<p>Produce the elements for values less than 1 and greater than zero (fractional values) 1 second produces hydrogen and 6 seconds produces carbon, and these are the lower and upper limits for integers producing a whole number of elements, putting hydrocarbons, the backbone of life chemistry as having components out of phase with one another by cycles of six in seconds. Seconds come from having divided the calendar according to the cycles of the moon, the spin frequency of the Earth, and its orbital period such that they all mesh with one another approximately according to special angles recurrent throughout mathematics and physics. These two equations have G, the universal gravitational constant among other parameters associated with the physics of everything. The cycle of six for the phase shift from hydrogen to carbon may be characteristic of physical forces because six-fold symmetry is often more characteristic of the physical where five-fold is more characteristic of life as was pointed-out by the Russian Scientist Shubnikov. One might look at this as something physical, like snowflakes form six points (six-fold radial symmetry) due to acceleration of an ice particulate against air gathering moisture and freezing it as it falls under earth gravity, and five-fold symmetry, as in the large variety of five-petaled flowers (five-fold radial symmetry) because it has the golden ratio in it, the ratio of the chord of a regular pentagon to its side, and six-fold symmetry embodies unity as the radius of a regular hexagon is equal to its side and the golden ratio is often used by life for closest packing, as occurs in the hundreds of petals in a rose spiraling in as a golden spiral to its center. These equation take us through a Universe-unfolding eventuation considering meteors, sand, and iron, and indeed themselves.</p>

<p> AI and biological life elements are mathematical constructs that are connected to one another. As well a constant is introduced for inertia that makes matter at the fundamental level of protons and electrons mathematical as well.</p>

<p><a href="proton_seconds.html">Click here to read Proton-Seconds And Its Applications (Posted November 28 2021)</a></p>

<p> If the elements are mathematical constructs, then we need to as well explain mass as a mathematical construct. Both ventures are taken on here. This leads to a model for inertia of matter as a three dimensional cross-section of a four-dimensional hypersphere, a bubble in space. Taking a proton as a  cross section of a bubble in space a concept is arrived at of proton-seconds which predicts integer solutions of protons, or elements in other words. This takes the form of a constant which uses the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, Planck’s constant, the fine structure constant, and the mass of a proton. A program that is written in C finds integer solutions as a function of time. The curious feature of this is one second even predicts six protons or carbon, the core element of life as we know it and in turn 6 seconds even predicts one proton, or hydrogen, which combines with carbon to make hydrocarbons, the backbone of organic matter. Thus the unit of a second is considered significant and taken as having it meaning in the ancient formation of the calendar which was based on early observations of the period of the earth’s orbit, which was in turn divided up into seconds based on important values such as 12, the smallest abundant number, and the special triangles 30, 60 , 90 in geometry and the division of the circle into 360 degrees. The concept of proton-seconds is applied to the asteroid belt, and has some curious accurate descriptions of the frequency of meteors that are large enough to become meteorites found on the Earth surface. </p>
