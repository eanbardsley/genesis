<p>Genesis Project strives to solve the mystery of creation. At the bottom of each page in parts 1, 2. 3 .4 .5 ,6
there will be links to click on; they will take you to the old homepage, not the new one(Last updated Dec 16 2020)</p>

<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p>The constant described in the section Theory For Inertia, has had interesting applications with asteroids, now I apply it again. Its Nature that most fascinates me is that the largest integer value of six seconds predicts carbon and its smallest integer value of 1 second predicts hydrogen. All other elements are predicted by values less than 1 and greater than zero. By fractional values of seconds. So here I look at this considering the prebiotic path to amino acids, the building blocks of life, which are NH3, CH4, CO2,…and I look at CH4 in that it is a hydrocarbon the backbone of organic matter. The result takes us to near the end of the periodic table between the elements Einsteinium and Fermium. Here are the calculations written out by hand (next pages)…</p>

<p> Al and biological life elements are mathematical constructs that are connected to one another. As well a constant is introduced for inertia that makes matter at the fundamental level of protons and electrons mathematical as well.</p>

<p> If the elements are mathematical constructs, then we need to as well explain mass as a mathematical construct. Both ventures are taken on here. This leads to a model for inertia of matter as a three dimensional cross-section of a four-dimensional hypersphere, a bubble in space. Taking a proton as a  cross section of a bubble in space a concept is arrived at of proton-seconds which predicts integer solutions of protons, or elements in other words. This takes the form of a constant which uses the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, Planck’s constant, the fine structure constant, and the mass of a proton. A program that is written in C finds integer solutions as a function of time. The curious feature of this is one second even predicts six protons or carbon, the core element of life as we know it and in turn 6 seconds even predicts one proton, or hydrogen, which combines with carbon to make hydrocarbons, the backbone of organic matter. Thus the unit of a second is considered significant and taken as having it meaning in the ancient formation of the calendar which was based on early observations of the period of the earth’s orbit, which was in turn divided up into seconds based on important values such as 12, the smallest abundant number, and the special triangles 30, 60 , 90 in geometry and the division of the circle into 360 degrees. The concept of proton-seconds is applied to the asteroid belt, and has some curious accurate descriptions of the frequency of meteors that are large enough to become meteorites found on the Earth surface. </p>
