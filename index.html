<p>It is rather abstract thinking, but just as the moment we define truth and as a result it reverses, I think we can treat problem solving this way.</p>

<p>The approach here (top of page 4) is doing physics with a chemistry methodology so the equations work due to having the right units. It uses dimensional analysis. I do this because when we try to say what is going on physically, the Nature of Reality evades us. For instance the fine structure squared is given by the potential energy of an electron in the first circular orbit, but the orbits as they exist in chemistry although used to make computations, don't exist, they are convenient models. Actually, and this is according to quantum mechanics they are clouds wherein an electron has a probability of existing.  In this sense the model I provided of a proton as a 3D cross-section of a 4D bubble is an interpretation of the equations but is not necessarily so, nor have to be the truth. Einstein was looking for some way to suggest a particle has a position in space, while  quantum mechanics says it does not, and that is why it has wave properties. Indeed the fine structure constant crops up in many many ways, and can have an infinity of interpretations. I believe this is because reality is an infinite regress, an endless pursuit, that is why I am started doing physics like this with a chemistry methodology. Really when I wrote this down, especially equation 3, I realized it opened a million doors I could see right away.  And this is much the Nature of reality, as Buckminster Fuller said for every geometrical relationship discovered spring up 20 more geometrical  discoveries that can be made.</p>

<p> I didn't say 1 second was special, it is just what it happens to be for six protons, the three examples given work without saying 1 second is special. However I have addressed this coincidence of 1 second in other works regarding this same paper, and have searched for why 1 second may be an important unit by looking at how we have it today. I found the second comes to us from the construction of the calendar based on reconciling approximately 12 moons with 1 year (one completion of the earth around the sun). This gave us 365 days close to 360 degrees in a circle, 12 hours a day, and 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. Dividing the minute into 60 seconds comes to us from the Babylonians who got it from the Sumerians, and was established in Ancient Greece by one of its early astronomers. Apparently the reason we divided the minutes whether into seconds of arc or seconds of time was because the Sumerians and Babylonians used a base 60 counting (sexagesimal) which is thought be because 60 is evenly divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...15, 20, 30. And this is what I am currently working on is that ultimately the way we constructed the calendar comes from the physics of how the primordial disc evolved into the solar system we have today. But that is another project and falls under archaeology. The reason I use the 1 second formulation I use is that it speaks of the sixfold symmetry we are seeing here: carbon six, hydrogen 1, hydrocarbons backbone of life.</p>

<p>In my paper An Approach: Proton-Seconds (Beardsley, 2022) I introduced the concept of proton-seconds and its uses in a method that determined a definition for the radius of the solar system, predicted the abundance of the primary elements from which matter is made in stars (hydrogen and helium) in the Universe, the skeletons of life hydrocarbons, and predicted the radius of a proton within the experimental errors. Here I introduce the concept of electron-seconds and a bit of what it suggests.With this counter part to earlier work, it may be we can approach the question of net charge in the universe.</p>

<p>An Approach: Proton-Seconds In essence it addresses not the Universe, but the Cosmos which is bigger in that the Universe is a subset of the Cosmos. The cosmos is everything that ever was, is, or will be. So while we predict the radius of a proton, determine a definition for the size of the solar system, and predict the relative abundances of the fundamental matter from which the elements were made, hydrogen and helium, in the big explosion that gave birth to the universe, as well we predict the existence of the skeletons of life, the hydrocarbons. The end in sight here, Buckminster Fuller's Syngergetics, a theorem, and we see it goes back to the Babylonians who invented astrology and gave us the mathematical system we use today via the Ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p> With the method of proton-seconds we can solve a great deal of problems easily. They define a definition for the radius of the solar system and predict the radius of a proton within its experimental errors to predicting the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe from which the heavier elements are made in the interior of stars. It is doing physics with a chemistry methodology.</p>

<p> We discover a constant that predicts hydrocarbons (the backbones of life) and determines a definition for the radius of the solar system, predicts the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe from which the heavier elements were made, the relative abundances of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth atmosphere, and that predicts the radius of the proton within its experimental errors. Incredibly this all ties into the ancient Babylonian origins of the calendar and their sexagesimal counting system. While this reconciles a lot between Newtonian Gravity and Quantum Mechanics, it becomes as well an Archaeological problem. </p>

<p>It would seem to not only are artificial intelligence elements mathematical constructs, but so are biological life elements, and they are described in terms of one another, this is the subject of part 1. It becomes necessary to say if these elements are subject to mathematical constructs then matter, or inertia is a mathematical construct. This results in a constant that not only predicts the hydrocarbons, the skeletons of life, but determines a definition for the radius of the solar system and predicts the radius of the proton. This is part 2. In part 3 we show this takes the form of a gaussian distribution meaning it can all be solved with wave mechanics. This leads to predicting the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium from which the other elements are made by stars in nucleosynthesis.</p>

<p>It is a mind blower that the constant on page 32 predicts the radius of a proton within the experimental errors which are within 14 thousandths of a femtometer using a time value of exactly 1 second because the second originated over ancient times as a means of parsing the phases of the earth and the moon. This is an archaeological problem and the reason for it might be deeply profound.</p>

<p>As we progress from carbon to the hydrocarbon skeletons of life we progress through proportions of the nitrogen and oxygen of the air through the same proportions in the components of sand and minerals found in semiconductor materials as distributed across the solar system in a linearly decreasing form of a thin disc. This ties into the duration of second, which derives from the orbital periods of the earth and moon as structured in the calendar we have today from basic fundamental geometrical relationships. Here we have a way to define the radius of the solar system and we predict the radius of the proton within its most recent experimental errors.</p>

The first part was a result of the need to develop the second part which describes life and AI elements as mathematical constructs connected to one another. But it was interesting in itself as it lead to a theoretical value for the proton radius in agreement with experiment and a definition of the radius of the solar system connected to the skeletons of life (hydrocarbons) and earth air.

<p> Here we have a way to define the radius of the solar system. As well at the end of the paper I give a theoretical value for the radius of a proton from this which is in close to the most recent measurements, and is good in terms of chemistry by say of what is suggested by our proton-seconds. Further it predicts the hydrocarbons the basic skeletons of life and the duration of a second which originates in the way we structured the calendar to the phases of the earth and the moon.</p>

<p> The idea that life could be part of a Universal Natural Process has been around for some time, perhaps starting with the astronomer Fred Hoyle. In my effort to show artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs I had formed a new constant that was interesting in itself. This short paper treats just it and what follows from it, since it has life connected to more universal values such as Planck‚Äôs constant, the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, the fine structure constant, the radius of a proton, and the mass of a proton. A program is written that shows it has incredible properties that predict all of the elements. It is suggested that its value is in design so a definition of design is used from Buckminster Fuller‚Äôs Synergetics. Ultimately, in the end the constant seems to be in step with the phases of the moon and the earth and they way they were divided-up by the Ancients to give us the calendar we have today. All of this in terms to be connected to the structure of the basis of geometry as founded on fundamental principles. </p>

<p>We do archaeology on Earth concerning the origins of humans and their thoughts about the world around them from ancient to modern times. The moon orbits the earth once in about 30 days, and does twelve of these revolutions in the time it takes the Earth to go around the Sun. The Druids who built Stonehenge knew this, and the Mayans who built their pyramids in Mexico observed it, and well as the Egyptians who built the Great Pyramid of Giza. All of these structures have celestial alignments, and the calendar we have today came from such knowledge of these ancients. But can we surmise what kind of calendar came into existence from the ancient astronomers of a planet orbiting another star? The stars are out of our reach, at least for resolving a moon orbiting a planet orbiting a star, but we can ascertain that planets exist around other stars, and even infer their mass, and orbital period. If we can start to know these things about other star systems, is it possible other life has begun to know them about ours. Or, have they perhaps even been here, or are they here now? I look into this here.</p>

<p>Produce the elements for values less than 1 and greater than zero (fractional values) 1 second produces hydrogen and 6 seconds produces carbon, and these are the lower and upper limits for integers producing a whole number of elements, putting hydrocarbons, the backbone of life chemistry as having components out of phase with one another by cycles of six in seconds. Seconds come from having divided the calendar according to the cycles of the moon, the spin frequency of the Earth, and its orbital period such that they all mesh with one another approximately according to special angles recurrent throughout mathematics and physics. These two equations have G, the universal gravitational constant among other parameters associated with the physics of everything. The cycle of six for the phase shift from hydrogen to carbon may be characteristic of physical forces because six-fold symmetry is often more characteristic of the physical where five-fold is more characteristic of life as was pointed-out by the Russian Scientist Shubnikov. One might look at this as something physical, like snowflakes form six points (six-fold radial symmetry) due to acceleration of an ice particulate against air gathering moisture and freezing it as it falls under earth gravity, and five-fold symmetry, as in the large variety of five-petaled flowers (five-fold radial symmetry) because it has the golden ratio in it, the ratio of the chord of a regular pentagon to its side, and six-fold symmetry embodies unity as the radius of a regular hexagon is equal to its side and the golden ratio is often used by life for closest packing, as occurs in the hundreds of petals in a rose spiraling in as a golden spiral to its center. These equation take us through a Universe-unfolding eventuation considering meteors, sand, and iron, and indeed themselves.</p>
