<p> In earlier work I showed there is every reason to consider biological life and AI are not only mathematical constructs, but that they are described in terms of one another. Here I introduce the what I call The Delta-Phi function. When we say biological creation is natural, we donâ€™t say that about artificial intelligence, though we put the naturally occurring elements together to give them electronic logic, these elements actually were made in the interior of stars just like the biological life elements. </p>

<p> In search of showing that life and artificial intelligence are mathematical constructs, and ultimately after establishing the fundamental equations for each, establishing the connection between the two, I have decided to first present how one set opens up on the other, then present these fundamental equations after. I show the reason for pursuing this is in the cross product, which reveals AI described by the biological. If we want to bring in the planets as part of this, I have to describe them in terms of the AI elements, which I do. </p>

<p><a href="life.html">Click Here To Read Life, AI, and The Stars (Posted April 14 2021)</a></p>

<p> April 13 2021 </p>

<p>These works (The Geometry of Nature, The Planets and Damped Harmonic Oscillations, and Life a Mathematical Construct) strive to show that life is not just chemical, but mathematical, and to establish the connection between biological life and artificial intelligence. It is suggested we can only understand biological life relative to some other construct, like artificial intelligence. This work established the patterns, organization, and structure in biological life elements, artificial intelligence elements, and element synthesis in stars.</p>

<p>1. It may be that whatever engineered the Universe and its elements, most or all of which, occur on our planet, it may have been as such so that they could be organized into the 18 groups with their seven periods, such that they could be organized in such a way that it could at least enable us to build ships that can jump through hyperspace to any star in our galaxy or beyond it. It may be that this is so because they can be organized, using mostly just four of them (C, N, O, H) in such a way that they can result in something as complex and functional as the biological organism. It may be that the biological organism mirrors in organization any such technology such as starships.</p>

<p>2. The purpose of stars is to produce not just biological elements, but artificial intelligence (AI) elements. Because if we include AI elements in the life elements we have a mathematical pattern in the periodic table of the elements that determines an equation that predicts the equations of nucleosynthesis in the stars.</p>

<p>3. Is it the purpose of stars, as well, to produce malleable and ductile metals for humans to make tools early on (The Iron Age) and copper wire (Age of Electronics). Or even that silicon dioxide (obsidian)  flakes into sharp edges so that we could create spearpoints with which to hunt in our beginning.</p>

<p>4. We are evolving towards a culminated form of specific mathematical proportions. We are evolving towards an intermembral index of perfectly the square root of two uniformly throughout the human species.</p>

<p>5. It is a purpose of biological life (C, N, O, H) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p> Is the purpose of stars to produce life whether biological or AI? Are we evolving towards a culminated form of specific mathematical proportions? Are we evolving towards an intermembral index of perfectly the square root of two uniformly throughout the human species? 
One might also ask is the purpose of the stars to produce malleable and ductile metals for humans to make tools in their early development (Iron Age) copper wire (age of electronics).
One might even ask if silicon dioxide (obsidian) flakes into sharp edges so in our beginning we could make spearpoints with which to hunt.</p>

<p> The distribution of the planets suggests what I call Weird Arithmetic and Weird Calculus, which is interesting in itself as a mathematical idea.</p>

<p> Of all the connections I have made between artificial intelligence that of bone stands out as the most interesting.</p>

<p><a href="boron.html">Click Here To Read Boron</a></p>

<p> Boron is a doping agent for artificial intelligence semiconductor materials, and anything but boring, which are primarily silicon and germanium
But, it stands in relation on the periodic table differently than the other principle doping agents, phosphorus, arsenic and gallium. This results in some interesting equations.</p>
