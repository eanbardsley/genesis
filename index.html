<p>Genesis Project strives to solve the mystery of creation. At the bottom of each page in parts 1, 2. 3 .4 .5 ,6

<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p><a href="SixFold.html">Click here to read The Basis of the Universe as Six-Fold Symmetry (December 31 2022)</a></p>

<p>It would seem at the basis of Nature is six-fold symmetry whether we are talking about biology, like it’s hydrocarbons skeleton, which we do here, or the orbits of the planets. I show the earth is the eigenvalue or characteristic root for the matrix that describes the solar system and to do this I formulate the solar system as six-fold symmetry and suggest this could be taken as a logos, a formulation of the language of Nature. I develop a constant k which is on larger scales compared to Planck’s constant on the quantum scale, and I find it is is necessary to look at the larger scales of chemistry using Avogadro’s number and the velocities of the planets, really to predict the radius of the proton in terms of not just Planck’s constant, but in terms of gravity, G, which takes us into the realm of Quantum Field Theory. Once we establish the idea of proton- seconds we find we can formulate chemical compounds as mathematical, algebraic constructs which is done here. The paper goes from fundamental particles like protons, to atoms, to compounds, and to the planets suggesting perhaps it is all part of the same thing in making up the Universe. </p>

<p><a href="calibrated.html">Click here to read Electric and Gravitational Fields Are Calibrated For Life (November 10 2022)</a></p>

<p>Here we look at the structure of Nature, what we think it is and why it is calibrated the way it is. We look at the structure of matter, space, and time, and show through the natural constants, which are a measure of the way matter space and time are calibrated, that this calibration is such that it allows for life from the microcosmos calibrated with Planck’s constant h for the subatomic particles such as protons, electrons, and photons, to the intermediary, like the elements made from the subatomic particles, and their ensuing compounds, such as the hydrocarbons the skeleton’s of life chemistry, to the Sun, the planets, and their moons on the large scale of the macrocosmos. We show there is some indication the structure of the microcosmos is formulated in terms of the intermediary realms such as the elements and their compounds, and in terms of the larger scale, the planets, moons and stars. We suggest this structure has the purpose of allowing for life, such that carbon, the core element of biological life chemistry, is at the core of the overall construct. We suggest the reason this scenario is so that the Universe can be conscious. We find a recursive 6-fold symmetry is behind all of this structure.</p>

<p><a href="SpaceTimeMatter.html">Click here to read A Theory of Space, Time, and Matter (November 02 2022)</a></p>

<p>We suggest it is worthwhile to explore six-fold symmetry by itself. It is shown that the radius of a proton and its mass can be derived from a theory of space and time. To do this a theory for the atom is achieved because the theory of the proton needs the unit of a second as a natural duration which can be achieved from the atom that is made of these protons. A theory of the atom needs to utilize Avogadro’s Number. This is done by introducing the concept of intermediary mass.</p>

<p>The concept of proton-seconds is introduced which results in a theory for compounds, combinations of atoms (which are combinations of protons). This is done for doped silicon and germanium which makes transistors and diodes enabling the engineering of logic circuit technology. It is also shown that the unit of a second is not just a natural duration where the atom is concerned, and hence the proton, but where the Earth-Moon-Sun orbital mechanics are concerned.</p>

<p>This is two works, one dealing with humans and their relationship to Nature, and one the archaeology of other star systems, thus the relationship of life beyond Earth to Nature. It is the author’s hope that we will be able to ﬁnd the common ground between the two.</p>
