<p>Genesis Project strives to solve the mystery of creation. At the bottom of each page in parts 1, 2. 3 .4 .5 ,6

<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p>Matter can be explained as a construct of space and time at the fundamental level of elementary particles, the elements of the periodic table follow from that construct. We demonstrate a recurrent six-fold symmetry of Nature and formulate logos, her language in abstract terms.</p>

<p> Matter can be explained as a construct of space and time at the fundamental level of elementary particles, the elements of the periodic table follow from that construct.</p>

<p><a href="Nature.html">Click here to read Logos: The Language of Nature (September 25 2022)</a></p>

<p>We suggest logos: The Language of Nature, is based on six-fold symmetry and as such determines the hydrocarbons which are the skeletons of life chemistry, the radius of a proton, and solves the solar system.</p>

<p><a href="logos.html">Click here to read A Proposal For Logos (September 24 2022)</a></p>

<p> The truth regarding Nature evades us at every turn. By constructing a formal system such as mathematics we require fractions which inherently have irrational numbers that can only be written in closed form such as  because it is an unending decimal expression 2.236067978… which to be utilized must be rounded to a value it is not. The search for truth is the search for logos, the language spoken by Nature, such that conundrums are overcome. This solution is suggested here to be in dimensionless whole numbers that derive from the relationship between point plane and line. We suggest here the core whole number is 6 and we introduce the concept of proton-seconds to explain this and the idea that the second is a natural unit. This results in the biological skeletons that are hydrocarbons and the radius of the proton. We proceed to propose the logos for the orbital velocity of celestial motions under gravity, and we show that it is six. At the end we solve the solar system for integer states, as if it were a quantum mechanical atom, that is has integer orbits.</p>

<p>We show the second which has a historical development based on watching the motions of the sun, earth, and moon, are connected to by the atomic world, and the orbital mechanics of the solar system.</p>

<p><a href="electrons.html">Click here to read Proton And Electron Seconds (September 13 2022)</a></p>

<p>We find we can look at the world of subatomic particles which is inaccessible deterministically by quantum physics, by looking at the planets, moons, and Suns and that we can look at the planets, moons, and Suns by looking at the world of subatomic microcosmos, through the abstract.</p>

<p>
What this says in an abstract way is that the Earth is a proton traveling at the speed of light in a universe where the Universal constant of gravitation is one.</p>

<p>In photographing atoms with ptychography the information received is not an image of atoms, and the image of the atoms is not a direct image but an inference based on a theory for the way particles interact with these particles that can only be validated by a direct image of the particles themselves. It is not necessarily an incorrect inference, but it would seem we can’t prove it is. This is where abstract natural systems comes in; we say it does not matter what is there, only that we have a working model or interpretation of the the atoms true or not because really these organizations of atoms can be treated as mathematical constructs.</p>

<p>Electron Microscopy, using electrons to see atoms, The photographs of atoms are more the scattering of electrons to look at them than the reflection which would be an actual image. But it is not attainable because in order to do this, to get the resolution required the electrons have to be increased to an energy that would destroy the material being looked at.</p>

<p>So they idea of abstract natural systems and my other work as well, abstract cosmology, is that what we are looking at is not necessarily continuous matter or discrete spherical particles, but at the simplest level, the mathematics of triangles, squares, hexagons, and pentagons, or octagons, which involve at their basis sqrt(2), sqrt(3), phi (the golden ratio) and so on…</p> </p>

<p>Abstract Cosmology is not concrete because the truth, if such a thing can even be shown to exist, escapes us at every juncture. Abstract cosmology looks for form in the relationship between point, plane, line, angle, etc...and and suggests it exists in Nature. With this process we will determine the radius of the proton, that makes the atom, predict the relationships between elements, in particular in the hydrocarbons that are the skeletons of life chemistry. We will move up in scale to the radius of the solar system, and in the end predict the relative abundances of the most abundant elements — the primordial elements hydrogen and helium — that make up 98% of the Universe. Along the way we will find the proportions of the primary constituents of the air that makes up the Earth atmosphere, and show they are integral to water geometrically. We will offer interpretations for space, time, and matter (inertia). It won’t be as important as to what the interpretations are as much as it will be that we can have them. It is done like this because it is suggested that reality is a construct of the mind, so models are only useful as tools to manipulate components in the mind.</p>

<p>This version has been expanded and as far the the author can tell typos all corrected, any arithmetic errors have been rectified and in his opinion has quite an extraordinary conclusion.</p>

<p> It would seem to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity we need perhaps more to find an equation that takes us between formal systems than to have a synthesis. </p>

<p><a href="Natural_Units.html">Click here to read The Search For Natural Units (Posted April 8 2022)</a></p>

<p>The units we use to measure physical quantities for mass, length, and time belong to several different systems of measurement. This results in slight variations in our answers whether we say use a foot or a centimeter to measure distance. It would be to the advantage of physics if we could find what will call natural units. This paper lightly explores the concept and strives to show such values already exist close to being natural if we look at constants and their relationship to physical reality.</p>

<p>It could be useful to use these, or even establish some that are more perfect, because they are connected to natural phenomenon which have explanations. If we use them as we do physics we might have Natural discoveries falling out on our laps. This might explain why when we do physics with such units for time and length that strange things we consider extraordinary coincidences, happen. It might actually be that they are often not coincidences at all.</p> 

<p>I think one of the most fascinating aspects of the search for natural units would be when we go to other star systems in the future and meet other civilizations and we learn of their units and how they might be founded on the physical principles behind they dynamics of their planet, star (or stars) and perhaps moons.</p>

<p><a href="Sentient.html">Click here to read Sentient Beings In The Universe: Here and Beyond Earth (Posted April 2 2022)</a></p>

<p> This is two works, one dealing with humans and there relationship to Nature, and one the archaeology of other star systems, thus the relationship of life beyond Earth to Nature. It is the author’s hope that we will be able to find the common ground between the two.</p>

<p> Our history was forged by the elements and minerals beginning with stones to craft spearpoints and copper, silver, and gold beginning with using these metals to make tools and weapons to in the end electrical wire for advanced technology. It would seem other life on other planets around other stars would have been forged by the same things. Perhaps they even had a moon that hung in their sky to completely eclipse their star as ours does with the Sun, letting us know that we are part of something cosmic. Perhaps there are subtle variations in their history, and they have an ancient history as vast and intriguing as ours. Perhaps one day we will go to other star systems, even become part of a galactic, or even intergalactic society and we will learn their histories and perhaps from them even learn something about ourselves and our histories.</p>

<p>We establish a constants called proton-seconds and a formulation I call Giordano’s Relationship, and find we can solve problems across a wide array of disciplines including predicting the radius of a proton which is centered around carbon, the core element of biological life as we know it, defining the radius of the solar system, and predicting the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe.</p>

<p><a href="Hominins.html">Click here to read The Human Scenario (Posted March 28 2022)</a></p>

<p> Life is intricately complex and a lot of perfect circumstances come together to make it possible. It may be that someone or something is responsible for it. It may be as well that we can find something hidden that can be measured here on Earth and from Earth that can tell us something about the human scenario, why we are here, and where we are headed. In the course of my research I have found some clues that may be precisely this. They are outlined here.</p>

<p><a href="archeostar.html">Click here to see Archaeology Of Other Starsystems (Posted March 20 2022)</a></p>

<p>We can infer the existence of a planet around a star we cannot see, but can we say something about the archaeology of its people as well.</p>

<p>A very interesting thing here is looking at the values generated by the program, the smallest integer value, 1 second produces 6 protons (carbon) and the largest integer values 6 seconds produces one proton (hydrogen). Beyond six seconds you have fractional protons, and the rest of the elements heavier than carbon are formed by fractional seconds.</p>

<p> The idea that life could be part of a Universal Natural Process has been around for some time, perhaps starting with the astronomer Fred Hoyle. In my effort to show artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs I had formed a new constant that was interesting in itself. This short paper treats just it and what follows from it, since it has life connected to more universal values such as Planck’s constant, the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, the fine structure constant, the radius of a proton, and the mass of a proton. A program is written that shows it has incredible properties that predict all of the elements. It is suggested that its value is in design so a definition of design is used from Buckminster Fuller’s Synergetics. Ultimately, in the end the constant seems to be in step with the phases of the moon and the earth and they way they were divided-up by the Ancients to give us the calendar we have today. All of this in terms to be connected to the structure of the basis of geometry as founded on fundamental principles. </p>
