<p>Genesis Project strives to solve the mystery of creation. At the bottom of each page in parts 1, 2. 3 .4 .5 ,6

<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so it can make computing machines, which are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p><a href="cosmology_02.html">Click here to read Abstract Cosmology (May 29 2022)</a></p>

<p> Abstract Cosmology is not concrete because the truth, if such a thing can even be shown to exist escapes us at every juncture. Abstract cosmology looks for form in the relationship between point, plane, line, angle, etc…and and suggests it exists in Nature. With this process we will determine the radius of the proton, that make the atom, predict the relationships between elements, in particular the hydrocarbons that are the skeletons of life chemistry. We will move up in scale to the radius of the solar system, and in the end predict the relative abundances of the most abundant elements — the primordial elements hydrogen and helium — that make up 98% of the Universe. Along the way we will find the proportions of the primary constituents of the air that makes up the Earth atmosphere, and show it they integral to water geometrically. We will offer interpretations for space, time, and matter (inertia). It won’t be as important as to what the interpretations are as much as it will be that we can have them. It is done like this because it is suggested that reality is a construct of the mind, so models are only useful as tools to manipulate components in the mind.</p>

<p><a href="cosmic_calendar.html">Click here to read A Natural Cosmic Calendar (May 22 2022)</a></p>

<p> Here we highlight some of the results we could consider the building blocks of creation; the hydrocarbons which are the skeletal structure of life chemistry, carbon the core element of life, the radius of the proton from which the elements are made, the radius of the solar system and the relative abundances of the most abundant elements in the universe hydrogen and helium from which all the others were made by stars in nucleosynthesis. We present the final results, but the full calculations are done in the appendices. The whole thing unfolds around a six-fold symmetry. In Appendix 1 we suggest the existence of a Natural Cosmic Calendar.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if there is a Natural Cosmic Calendar, and we have zeroed it and found another date as well, can we project our trajectory into the future, and figure out what age we are in now? The scientists are calling our age the anthropocene meaning "The age of Man" in the sense that He/She has altered the face of the Earth burning fossil fuels and putting CO2 into the atmosphere at record levels.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I have a book which is a series of lectures given by the British astronomer Fred Hoyle when he visited U of O and gave lectures there. In one of the lectures he likened humans to going down a raging river and not knowing what lay ahead. He suggested that the amount of oil in a planet that has life is a constant ratio because too much and the planet would collapse from lack of solid. He went on that any civilization that discovered burning oil would deplete it at the time it discovered nuclear power, thus having another energy source at the depletion. He further went on that other civilizations in the Universe could have already passed down the raging river successfully, and had written a galactic encyclopedia explaining how they got past certain dangers and that if we could have access to such an encyclopedia we could know how to manage our way down the river in front of us by having some idea of what lay ahead.</p>

We present the final results, but the full calculations are done in the appendices. The whole thing unfolds around a six-fold symmetry.</p>
<p>Something interesting at the end of appendix one: Around 500 to 600 million years ago the earth went through some kind of drastic change where there was a big explosion of complex life, this is exactly the figure I get for syncing my calendar.</p>

<p> We see that the periodic tables is cyclical over 18 groups of periodicity of 18 that is the interplay of 2 and 3 through a factor of six. We see this is the basis for many ancient music traditions over the globe, and not only predicts the radius of a proton in terms of carbon the core element of life (element 6) but explains the ancient Greek formulation of the elements as Earth, Air, Water, and Fire with modern chemistry.</p>

<p> It would seem to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity we need perhaps more to find an equation that takes us between formal systems than to have a synthesis. </p>

<p><a href="formulations.html">Click here to read The Formulations In Space And Time (Posted April 26 2022)</a></p>

<p> We show the protons are of a mathematical nature in space and time, as well as the elements in the periodic table of the elements, the hydrocarbons which are the skeletons of life chemistry, the radius of the solar system, and the abundance of the primordial elements hydrogen and helium, among many other structural elements connected to all of these. </p>

<p><a href="protons_vector_equilibrium.html">Click here to read Proton-Seconds And The Vector Equilibrium (Posted April 19 2022)</a></p>

<p> We observe six-fold symmetry in space and time and that through Buckminster Fuller’s Vector Equilibrium we see the periodic table of the elements is an extension of space and time.  The unit of a second follows from this, as well as the hydrocarbons, the skeletons of life chemistry, the radius of a proton, the radius of the solar system, and the relative abundances of the most abundant elements in the universe hydrogen and helium. We further suggest the crux of the periodic table is in that the life elements describe the artificial intelligence elements. </p>

<p><a href="Natural_Units.html">Click here to read The Search For Natural Units (Posted April 8 2022)</a></p>

<p>The units we use to measure physical quantities for mass, length, and time belong to several different systems of measurement. This results in slight variations in our answers whether we say use a foot or a centimeter to measure distance. It would be to the advantage of physics if we could find what will call natural units. This paper lightly explores the concept and strives to show such values already exist close to being natural if we look at constants and their relationship to physical reality.</p>

<p>It could be useful to use these, or even establish some that are more perfect, because they are connected to natural phenomenon which have explanations. If we use them as we do physics we might have Natural discoveries falling out on our laps. This might explain why when we do physics with such units for time and length that strange things we consider extraordinary coincidences, happen. It might actually be that they are often not coincidences at all.</p> 

<p>I think one of the most fascinating aspects of the search for natural units would be when we go to other star systems in the future and meet other civilizations and we learn of their units and how they might be founded on the physical principles behind they dynamics of their planet, star (or stars) and perhaps moons.</p>

<p><a href="Sentient.html">Click here to read Sentient Beings In The Universe: Here and Beyond Earth (Posted April 2 2022)</a></p>

<p> This is two works, one dealing with humans and there relationship to Nature, and one the archaeology of other star systems, thus the relationship of life beyond Earth to Nature. It is the author’s hope that we will be able to find the common ground between the two.</p>

<p> Our history was forged by the elements and minerals beginning with stones to craft spearpoints and copper, silver, and gold beginning with using these metals to make tools and weapons to in the end electrical wire for advanced technology. It would seem other life on other planets around other stars would have been forged by the same things. Perhaps they even had a moon that hung in their sky to completely eclipse their star as ours does with the Sun, letting us know that we are part of something cosmic. Perhaps there are subtle variations in their history, and they have an ancient history as vast and intriguing as ours. Perhaps one day we will go to other star systems, even become part of a galactic, or even intergalactic society and we will learn their histories and perhaps from them even learn something about ourselves and our histories.</p>

<p><a href="protons_alpha.html">Click here to read Proton-Seconds And Alpha (Posted March 31 2022)</a></p>

<p>We establish a constants called proton-seconds and a formulation I call Giordano’s Relationship, and find we can solve problems across a wide array of disciplines including predicting the radius of a proton which is centered around carbon, the core element of biological life as we know it, defining the radius of the solar system, and predicting the relative abundances of hydrogen and helium in the Universe.</p>

<p><a href="Hominins.html">Click here to read The Human Scenario (Posted March 28 2022)</a></p>

<p> Life is intricately complex and a lot of perfect circumstances come together to make it possible. It may be that someone or something is responsible for it. It may be as well that we can find something hidden that can be measured here on Earth and from Earth that can tell us something about the human scenario, why we are here, and where we are headed. In the course of my research I have found some clues that may be precisely this. They are outlined here.</p>

<p>We can infer the existence of a planet around a star we cannot see, but can we say something about the archaeology of its people as well.</p>

<p><a href="patterns.html">Click here to read Reality As Patterns: The Method of Proton-Seconds. (Posted March 27 2022)</a></p>

<p> We introduce the concept of Proton-Seconds and see it lends itself to a method of solving problems across a large range of disciplines in the Natural Sciences. The underpinnings seem to be in 6-fold symmetry. This lends itself to a Universal Form. We find this presents the Periodic Table of the Elements as a squaring of the circle. It is rather abstract thinking, but just as the moment we define truth and as a result it reverses, I think we can treat problem solving this way: As Patterns…The idea is there is nothing we can say is the truth, but we can solve problems through pattern recognition. I would think this manner of problem solving through pattern recognition could be employed in developing deep learning machine intelligence and AI for its method of imitating human learning to gain knowledge.</p>

<p>A very interesting thing here is looking at the values generated by the program, the smallest integer value, 1 second produces 6 protons (carbon) and the largest integer values 6 seconds produces one proton (hydrogen). Beyond six seconds you have fractional protons, and the rest of the elements heavier than carbon are formed by fractional seconds.</p>

<p> The idea that life could be part of a Universal Natural Process has been around for some time, perhaps starting with the astronomer Fred Hoyle. In my effort to show artificial intelligence and biological life elements are mathematical constructs I had formed a new constant that was interesting in itself. This short paper treats just it and what follows from it, since it has life connected to more universal values such as Planck’s constant, the universal constant of gravitation, the speed of light, the fine structure constant, the radius of a proton, and the mass of a proton. A program is written that shows it has incredible properties that predict all of the elements. It is suggested that its value is in design so a definition of design is used from Buckminster Fuller’s Synergetics. Ultimately, in the end the constant seems to be in step with the phases of the moon and the earth and they way they were divided-up by the Ancients to give us the calendar we have today. All of this in terms to be connected to the structure of the basis of geometry as founded on fundamental principles. </p>
