<p>Genesis Project strives to solve the mystery of creation. At the bottom of each page in parts 1, 2. 3 .4 .5 ,6
there will be links to click on; they will take you to the old homepage, not the new one(Last updated Dec 16 2020)</p>

<p>There is some indication that artificial intelligence elements and biological life elements are not just mathematical constructs (as opposed to chemical constructs) but that they describe one another. As such, if we can show that these mathematical constructs are invariant under transformation, then they are tensors and are Natural Laws. Ultimately these tensors must be explained with Quantum Chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be that, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the origin of life we need to include the AI elements and their connection to biological life. I believe it is a purpose of biological life (H, N, C, O) to discover the properties of (P, B, Si) so can make computing machines, we are ultimately necessary to its survival.</p>

<p><a href="elements.html">Click here to read The Elements As Mathematical Constructs (Updated November 16 2021)</a></p>

<p> If the elements are mathematical constructs, then we need to as well explain mass as a mathematical construct. Both ventures are taken on here. It would seem they are such construct based around pi.</p>

<p>Not does this only mean that the second is cyclical with the earth orbital period in that 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365 days in years, four 30 day moons in a month, and with 360 degrees in a circle is close to 360 days a year (the earth moves through about one degree a year) and 360 divides evenly by the special angles used most in physics 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees,...but with this idea of proton-seconds it is cyclical with the number 6 in terms of hydrogen and carbon (six protons is one second, 1 proton is six seconds) and hydrogen and carbon make the backbones of organic matter at the core of biological life as we know it, the hydrocarbons. This is all in turn connected with equation 1 to the universal gravitational constant G, the speed of light, Planck's constant, and the fine structure constant. I really wonder if other planetary systems around other stars are connected dynamically with hydrocarbons. We really can't resolve planets around other stars because the stars are so far and so bright compared to the planets that orbit them. But we can infer their orbital periods by looking at the cyclical motion of stars due to the tug on them by planets orbiting them. But the planets have to be pretty massive currently for such inferences to be made. It is hard to do with earth size planets. But that may change.</p>

<p> Since the earth day gets longer at a rate of one hour per 0.0067 million years. Then the earth will be (24)(365.25/360)=24.35 hours per day when it goes through 360 degrees per year. This will be in 0.35/0.0067=52.2388 million years or the year 522,408,21.</p>

<p>I had been working on an explanation for inertia when I discovered the equation used in my paper on meteorites (Asteroids/Meteors/Meteorites 01 02 03 04, Beardsley 2021)...</p>

<p>It may be the origins and fate of life can be found in these small rocks found on Earth called the meteorites. It would seem the dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago because a meteor impacted the Earth in the Yucatan. This kicked up a lot of dust into the atmosphere blocking sunlight causing darkness and vegetation to die, only the small mammals were very successful. It would seem this gave way for humans to evolve from mammals instead of becoming reptilian. In this sense we might guess much intelligent life in the universe could be of a Reptilian Nature, if the process by which life happens is Universal. Can we understand our origins by looking at small rocks that burn-up and make it to the Earth surface, that originated in the asteroid belt, a place where matter was torn apart into anything from small pebbles to, meter-wide rocks, to several miles in diameter, because of its distance from the sun and the spacing of the planets acting on them? Incredible enough this vast region of small rocks, and large iron-nickel boulders is shown here to be so deeply connected with the physical constants that arise from the Nature of the relationships between mass, length, and time in our Universe, that as unfathomable as it would seem, with this small rocks found on earth we can arrive at some remarkably accurate results.There is a big mystery surrounding life and it seems to be connected to the meteors</p>
